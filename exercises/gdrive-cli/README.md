# GDrive CLI

Welcome to GDrive CLI, a cool CLI tool for dealing with Google Drive! This project is my first, kinda serious Rust project that I build for learning purposes. The idea is that it can be used as a blueprint for other, similar, API-based CLI apps.

## Get started

You can run 

```
cargo build
```

and

```
cargo run
```

to try out the app. In case you want to add subcommands and arguments, you can use the `---` separator, like `cargo run --- upload <source> <destination>`.
